This DOES NOT include projects unrelated to the game, such as projects that would be considered unrelated intellectual properties (such as a new game).

To open the project, you will need version 3.4.5 of Godot, which you can download here: https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.4.5-stable/

For the backgrounds, you can use this tool to make them: https://mrpedrobraga.itch.io/modot-distortionator
The version of the addon in that link is newer than the version used in this project, so you will need download the Godot Integration Addon 1.0.5 and install it into the project's addons folder.
